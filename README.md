#Research Features Project
This project is to document various features that we want to explore further.
This gives us a place to investigate and learn about these features.
Each package under com.doterra.research is a separate topic.

##Default Methods
This is a small module where we explore default methods in interfaces.

##Lambda Expressions
The LamdaExamples class contains a main method where you can run the examples.
